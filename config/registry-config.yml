# NOTE: Proxy mode is disabled because it prevents pushing custom images.
# Docker Registry in proxy mode can only cache images FROM the upstream registry,
# it cannot store locally-built images. When proxy is enabled, push operations
# fail with "denied: requested access to the resource is denied" because the
# registry tries to verify blobs against Docker Hub.
#
# To enable pull-through caching, you would need a separate registry instance.
