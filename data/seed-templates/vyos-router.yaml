  VyOS network router container for internal routing between network segments.
  Deploy under the edge router to segment your range into multiple LANs with
  custom routing, NAT, and firewall rules.

  Features:
  - Full routing between connected networks
  - NAT/masquerade for internet access
  - DHCP server per interface
  - Firewall/ACL support
  - VPN capabilities (IPsec, WireGuard, OpenVPN)

  Note: Each range gets an automatic edge router for external connectivity.
  This template is for deploying additional internal routers.
